# Creating a Plugin

In this tutorial, we will create our first plugin. In Windows, open a terminal inside the devkit directory. Then type:

```sh
.\bin\flare.exe create-plugin
```

If you are using Linux or Mac, type:
```sh
./bin/flare create-plugin
```

Follow the instructions in the command prompt and enter the necessary details for your plugin.
After that, your plugin will be created inside the `plugins` directory.
